		<li>Simply a masterpiece -- a work of art in the genre. Not only does it engage the mind with mysterious happenings, vagaries, and mostly intelligent dialogue, but also captures the senses with a superb visual style made possible by brilliant technology. -- <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/11/15/half-life-2-review"><em>IGN</em></a></li>
		<li>Half-Life 2 has astonished us from start to finish.

It is much more than a science-fiction shoot-'em up: the adventure has convincing characters with great emotional depth and thrilling cinematic set pieces providing astonishing spectacle. -- <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/news/Games/Pick-of-the-bunch/2004/12/01/1101577493985.html"><em>The Sydney Morning Herald</em></a></li>

		<li>This game is so close to flawless it's painful to the eye.
