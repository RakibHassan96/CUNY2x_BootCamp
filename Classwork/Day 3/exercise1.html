	<p>Write a program to calculate the total price of your phone purchase. You will keep purchasing phones (hint: loop!) until you run out of money in your bank account. You'll also buy accessories for each phone as long as your purchase amount is below your mental spending threshold.</p>
	<p>After you've calculated your purchase amount, add in the tax, then print out the calculated purchase amount, properly formatted.</p>
	<p>Finally, check the amount against your bank account balance to see if you can afford it or not.</p>
	<p>You should set up some constants for the "tax rate," "phone price," "accessory price," and "spending threshold," as well as a variable for your "bank account balance.""</p>
	<p>You should define functions for calculating the tax and for formatting the price with a "$" and rounding to two decimal places.</p>
