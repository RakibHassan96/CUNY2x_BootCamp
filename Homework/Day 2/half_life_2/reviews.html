	<h1>Reviews</h1>
		<p style="color: black">Simply a masterpiece -- a work of art in the genre. Not only does it engage the mind with mysterious happenings, vagaries, and mostly intelligent dialogue, but also captures the senses with a superb visual style made possible by brilliant technology. -- <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/11/15/half-life-2-review"><strong><em>IGN</em></strong></a></p>
		<p style="color: black">Half-Life 2 has astonished us from start to finish. Valve has done to the FPS genre what restaurants in Chinatown do to ducks; shredded it, smothered it in a delicious sauce of their own devising, and served it up in a way which you simply couldn't have imagined when looking at them in the pond. -- <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_half-life2_pc"><strong><em>Eurogamer</em></strong></a></p>
		<p style="color: black">No other game provides such rich atmosphere or better blends exciting action with sublime storytelling. It is much more than a science-fiction shoot-'em up: the adventure has convincing characters with great emotional depth and thrilling cinematic set pieces providing astonishing spectacle. -- <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/news/Games/Pick-of-the-bunch/2004/12/01/1101577493985.html"><strong><em>The Sydney Morning Herald</em></strong></a></p>
		<p style="color: black">Half-Life 2 is a first-person shooter. But in action, storytelling, technical achievement, atmosphere and intensity it has far outdone its peers. Valve just hit the top note no other PC game developer could reach...The excuse that 'it's just a game' won't cut it anymore. -- <strong><em>Edge Magazine</em></strong></p>
		<p style="color: black">This is a jaw-dropping, exhilirating game -- <strong><em>Yahoo!</em></strong></p>
		<p style="color: black">No other game does as many things as well as Half-Life 2; I had so much fun that I can forgive the game its abysmal ending. I was continually enthralled and amazed. -- <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/25/technology/circuits/a-big-sequel-thats-worthy-of-its-lineage.html"><strong><em>The NY Times</em></strong></a></p>
		<p style="color: black">History in the making. It raises the bar for interactive entertainment, and then uses that bar to club all other games into submission...Valve has forged the framework for the next generation of games, demonstrating what our medium can and should be able to accomplish - an exhilarating entertainment that can emotionally move you one moment, kick ass the next, and keep you immersed the whole time. -- <strong><em>PC Gamer</em></strong></p>
		<p style="color: black">Half-Life 2, simply put, is a complete masterpiece; once again, the definition of what gaming is all about. Shame on you if you havenâ€™t already played it. Loser. -- <strong><em>Gaming Horizon</em></strong></p>
		<p style="color: black">This game is so close to flawless it's painful to the eye. It's so beautifully constructed, so immaculate, I can barely bring myself to divulge its details...Simply the most essential gaming experience of the year, the game the entire FPS genre has been building towards for the past decade, and one of the defining moments of the videogame medium as a whole. -- <strong><em>Computer and Video Games</em></strong></p>
		<p style="color: black">If you're looking for a game that sucks you right into the screen, this is it. This is your FPS benchmark, this is the game of the year; this game is the beautiful, imaginative, detailed masterpiece of 2004. -- <strong><em>GameBiz</em></strong></p>
